            <p>As a graduate of Life University®, you heard it from me!!!!
                <br>
                I used to work at an inn and interviewed the richest clients on their secrets! They all agree with
                this
                list!
            </p>

            <!-- Rule 2 -->

                for
                riches!
                <br>
                Every morning I wake up with my arms outstretched and I scream, "Money, get ready for me!"
                <br>
                I'm always wearing my business wear because it's always time to hustle!! Everyone and anyone is a

                <br>
                Face life as a challenge! If I get knocked down, you bet yourself I'm getting back up because I'm
                confident that positivity is waiting for me!

                money to
                me.
                <br>
